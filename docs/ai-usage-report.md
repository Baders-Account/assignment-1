I have used ChatGPT as my AI tool.

Use Cases: 

* Debugging: 
    
    1- CSS not loading on GitHub Pages
        While deploying my webpage on GitHub Pages, the CSS styles were not applied correctly. I asked ChatGPT about the issue, and it suggested checking the file paths to ensure they weren’t pointing outside the root directory. After verifying, I found this was indeed the problem and was able to fix it.
    
    2- Responsiveness issues 
        When testing the responsiveness of my website, the layout became messy. Although I had added media queries, they did not work as expected. ChatGPT explained that the best practice is to design first for small screens and then use media queries to adjust for larger screens. Since my structure was built in the opposite way, I asked ChatGPT to modify my existing structure to save time. I reviewed the generated code and confirmed that it worked correctly.

    3- Theme toggle in JavaScript
        I implemented a theme toggle function in JavaScript, but it did not work because I was mistakenly referencing a class element instead of the body element. ChatGPT reviewed the code and pointed out the issue, allowing me to correct it.

    4- CSS rules and media queries
        I initially placed specific CSS rules outside media queries, expecting them to change with screen size. However, they were always overridden by later rules. After consulting ChatGPT, I realized that such rules need to be placed inside @media queries to properly adjust with screen width.





* Code Generation: 

    1- To save time, I used ChatGPT to generate a simple button structure in HTML. 
    2- I also used it to generate the general HTML structure, including <!DOCTYPE html>, <link>, and <meta> tags.
    3- ChatGPT provided general CSS rules for elements like <h1>, <h3>, and <p>.
    4- It also generated the base structure for a form.




* Ducumentation:
    For the documentation part of my assignment, I wrote base drafts of each required document. Since I expected grammar and structure issues, I used ChatGPT to polish and improve them for clarity.





* Benefits & Challenges: 
    
    Benefits:
        it saves time by providing quick solutions 
    
        Helps you build skills and reach a level faster than the normal-paced learning curve of UI design.

        Functions as a powerful search and reference engine. 

    Challenges:
        Often, if the prompt is not well-written, ChatGPT may generate incorrect answers that can hinder understanding. 

        Deep learning still requires time and practice. With ChatGPT, there is a risk of relying too much on quick answers, which may cause you to forget concepts if you don’t keep practicing. 

* Learning outcomes: 
    Gained a solid understanding of how CSS Grid and Flexbox work. 
    
    Learned how to begin designing a responsive website.
    
    Observed how conflicts between CSS rules can become complicated, and learned methods to prevent them. 



* How I Modified AI Suggestions Responsibly:
    I verified the code before implementing it, either by relying on my own knowledge, checking the course slides, or confirming through trusted sources on Google.

    I rewrote every piece of code instead of copying and pasting it, so that I could gain hands-on experience and carefully pay attention to every detail.

    I asked about the reasoning behind each suggestion and explored possible alternatives to ensure i fully understood the solution.
